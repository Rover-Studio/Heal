# Heal
# Life is too busy. Stop your steps, look far away, feel freedom, and heal yourself.
Take a rest here. There is still a long way to go in life. It's better to enjoy the present.
Why do you always desperately prove that your existence is more meaningful than others? Existence itself is beautiful enough.
